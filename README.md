# Funny Dog Names Web App

The Funny Dog Names Web App is a simple web application built with Express.js, designed to display funny dog names and collect user-submitted names. This README will provide an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run it on your local machine.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following components:

- `server.js`: This is the main server script that configures the Express.js server, sets up routes, and listens for incoming requests.

- `routes/home.js` and `routes/funny-name.js`: These files define the routes for the home page and the "funny name" page, respectively. The app displays funny dog names on the home page and allows users to submit new names on the "funny name" page.

- `util/path.js`: This file defines a utility function to determine the root directory of the project.
